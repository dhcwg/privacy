1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] is a protocol that is used to provide addressing and
   configuration information to IPv6 hosts.  The DHCPv6 protocol uses
   several identifiers that could become a source for gleaming
   additional information about the IPv6 host.  This information may
   include device type, operating system information, location(s) that
   the device may have previously visited etc.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Identifiers in DHCPv6

   There are several identifiers used in DHCPv6.  This section provides
   a short introduction to the various options that will be used further
   in the document.

3.1.  DUID

   Each DHCPv6 client and server have a DHCP Unique
   Identifier(DUID)[RFC3315].  The DUID is designed to be unique across
   all DHCP clients and servers, and to remain stable after it has been
   initially generated.  The DUID can be of different forms.  Commonly
   used forms are based on the link-layer address of one of the device's
   network interfaces (with or without a timestamp), on the Universally
   Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC6355], etc.

3.2.  Client ID Option

   The Client Identifier Option (OPTION_CLIENTID) is used to carry the
   DUID of a DHCPv6 client between a client and a server.  There is an
   analogous Server Identifier Option but it is not of much interest in
   the privacy context.

3.3.  IA_NA, IA_TA and the IA Address Options

   The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (IA_NA) option
   [RFC3315] is used to carry the parameters and any non-temporary
   addresses associated with the given IA_NA.  The IA_TA option is
   analogous to the IA_NA option but for temporary addresses.  The IA
   Address option is used to specify IPv6 addresses associated with an
   IA_NA or an IA_TA and is encapsulated within the Options field of
   such an IA_NA or IA_TA option.

3.4.  Interface ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes the Interface ID [RFC3315] option to identify
   the interface on which it received the client message thatis being
   relayed.

3.5.  Subscriber ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes a Subscriber ID option [RFC4580] to associate
   some provider-specific information with clients' DHCPv6 messages that
   is independent of the physical network configuration.

3.6.  Remote ID

   A DHCPv6 relay includes a Remote ID option [RFC4649] to identify the
   remote host end of the circuit.

3.7.  FQDN Option

   The Client FQDN option [RFC4704] is used by DHCPv6 clients and
   servers to exchange information about the client's fully qualified
   domain name

3.8.  Client Link-layer Address Option

   The Client link-layer address option [RFC6939] is used by first-hop
   DHCPv6 relays to provide the client's link-layer address towards the
   server.

3.9.  Option Request Option

   DHCPv6 clients include an Option Request option in DHCPv6 messages to
   inform the server about options the client wants the server to send
   to the client.

3.10.  Vendor Class Option

   This option is used by a DHCPv6 client to identify the vendor that
   manufactured the hardware on which the client is running.

3.11.  Civic Location Option

   DHCPv6 servers use the Civic Location Option [RFC4776] to convey the
   civic and postal addresses to DHCPv6 clients.

4.  Attacks

4.1.  Finding device type

   The type of device used by the client can be guessed by the attacker
   using the Vendor Class Option, the Client Link-layer Address Option,
   and by parsing the Client ID Option.

4.2.  Finding operating system

   The operating system running on a client can be guessed using the
   Vendor Class Option, or by using fingerprinting techniques on the
   combination of options requested using the Option Request Option.

4.3.  Finding civic address information

   The civic address can be obtained by the attacker by many means.  The
   most direct way to obtain this information is by looking into a
   server initiated message that contains the Civic Location Option.  It
   can also be indirectly infered using the Remote ID Option (e.g. using
   a telephone number), the Interface ID option (e.g. if an access
   circuit on an Access Node corresponds to a civic location), or the
   Subscriber ID Option (if the attacker has access to subscriber info).

4.4.  Finding previously visited networks

   When DHCPv6 clients to a network they attempt to request the same
   address they had before they attached to a network.  They do this by
   putting the previously assigned address in the IA Address Options
   inside the IA_NA, IA_TA.  By observing these addresses, an attacker
   can identify the network the client had previously visited.

4.5.  Finding a stable identity

   An attacker might use a stable identity gleamed from DHCPv6 messages
   to correlate activities of a given client on unrelated networks.  The
   Client FQDN option, the Subscriber ID Option and the Client ID
   options can serve as long lived identifiers of DHCPv6 clients.  The
   Client FQDN option can also provide an identity that can easily be
   correlated with web server activity logs.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA actions required.
